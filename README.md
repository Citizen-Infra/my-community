# My Community

A Chrome extension that turns your new tab into a community dashboard. Stay connected to your communities without endless scrolling.

## What you get

**Community Digest** — Curated links shared by your communities, with thumbnails and descriptions. No algorithmic noise, just what your people are reading.

**Bluesky Network** — Popular posts from people you follow, sorted by engagement. See what resonated in the last 24 hours, week, or month. Connect your Bluesky account to enable this feed.

**Participation** — Upcoming sessions, deliberations, and events from your communities. Never miss an opportunity to join the conversation.

Toggle any feed on or off. Choose light, dark, or system theme. The extension works without Bluesky — digest and participation are always available.
